# J-Quiz App
https://kind-liskov-38b895.netlify.app/ 

## Problem
My friends don't stay updated on me becuase I don't post on social media.

## Solution
Created a quiz that will not only test their knowledge about me but also update them about me. (lil narcissistic, ik :} ) 

## Stack 
It's a full stack app. 
- Backend uses express server, Node.Js and mongoDB(atlas).
  - The reason i chose this stack for backend was because I have already worked on project with same backend stack.
- Frontend uses Svelte framework 
  - I came across Svelte and it seemed very intresting to me so I used it for creating the quiz app so I can practice.
 
## Trade-Offs
- App doesn't support all screen sizes only big screens (laptop full-screen). CSS needs to be updated to support mobile screens.
- App doesn't have user authentication or sessions/cookies (so if you refresh the user is gone!)
- No way for users to suggest questions or answers.
- Not showing stats like : how many people choose the same options as user and other cool metrics.
- I could have used known FE framework and made the app look more fancy.
